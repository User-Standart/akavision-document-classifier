# 🏅 Challenge

**AKAER** deals with the management of technical documents, an activity that demands significant time due to the volume and complexity of the concepts involved.

Today, a professional needs to read each document, manually associate it with technical standards and other related documents already stored in the company's databases, and assign labels to make future searches easier. Being a manual process, it takes hours of work and is prone to errors.

The core challenge of this initiative is to build a **technical document classifier** capable of ingesting, classifying, and indexing documents — supporting natural language search grounded in the actual archive, while enforcing access control by confidentiality level and compliance with LGPD.

<span id="solution"></span>

# 🏅 Solution

The proposed solution is a **document classification and retrieval platform** running entirely on **local infrastructure**, with no dependency on external APIs for document processing or answer generation.

The system will enable:

- Upload and classification of technical documents by confidentiality level (Public, Internal, Restricted, Confidential, Sensitive)
- Text extraction and OCR for scanned documents, preserving structure for citation by excerpt
- Semantic search over the archive using locally hosted embeddings
- Natural language question answering, with every claim traceable back to a document, revision, page and section
- Access control combining document classification and user profile, enforced at retrieval time
- Compliance with LGPD through data anonymization, access logging and de-characterization records

The goal is to reduce the manual effort of reading, classifying and cross-referencing technical documents, while keeping every answer auditable and grounded in the company's own archive.

## 📐 Product Decisions

Closed decisions made by the Product Owner that orient every User Story. Changing one of these requires reviewing the affected stories.

| ID | Topic | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Architecture | Document processing and answer generation run on a local model. No external AI API calls in the document pipeline. |
| D2 | AI | Every AI answer cites the source document and revision. |
| D3 | AI | The answer is split into "Extracted from document" and "AI interpretation" blocks, with a notice that the interpretation is not an official company determination. |
| D4 | Taxonomy | The taxonomy has three levels: Area, Category and Subcategory, plus free tags. |
| D5 | Data Model | A document can belong to multiple areas (N:N relationship), with exactly one marked as the **primary area** and the rest as secondary. A document is never duplicated across areas. |
| D6 | Metadata | Reference standard is an optional field. A document without an associated standard enters the archive normally. |
| D7 | Metadata | **Updated.** Required upload fields (16 total): title, identifier/code, document type, revision number, issue date, effective date (when applicable), responsible area, category and subcategory, status, classification level, origin/source, document owner, language, related standard (when applicable), validity date (when applicable), original file. |
| D8 | Security | **Updated.** Four classification levels exist: **Public, Internal, Restricted, Confidential** (the previous fifth level, Sensitive, was removed). |
| D9 | Security | **Updated.** Permission is the combination of **user/group + area + classification**. Belonging to an area does NOT automatically grant access to every document in that area. A document may also carry its own restriction outside the general rule, for exceptional cases. |
| D10 | Security | **Updated.** AI-processing authorization is a policy separate from classification: Public = allowed · Internal = allowed per policy · Restricted = requires explicit authorization · Confidential = blocked by default. The system records who authorized processing, when, and which document version. |
| D11 | Security | **Updated.** Without permission, minimal existence applies: the user sees only an "access not authorized" message — no title, excerpt, summary or content. For sensitive documents, not even the title is shown. |
| D12 | Process | Publishing flow: Upload → Initial classification → Validation → Available. Whoever uploads a document cannot approve their own document. |
| D13 | Process | **Updated.** Requests for a missing document are routed by the **area of the category**, with a central governance area handling exceptions where no owner is defined. |
| D14 | AI | The archive may contain English documents; questions may be asked in Portuguese or English. The answer is given in the language of the question, while the cited excerpt stays in its original language. Supported languages are kept in configuration, so new ones can be added without changing the system structure. |
| D15 | Performance | Term search under 2 seconds; AI query under 10 seconds. |
| D16 | Validation | Product validation scenario: material compatibility, in Engineering. |
| D17 | Data Model | **New.** Documents can be related to one another: Complements, Amends, References, Supersedes. Relations are registered once and shown on both linked documents' records. |
| D18 | Data Model | **New.** Document status: Current, Superseded, Cancelled, Under Review. Only the Current version appears in search; older versions remain visible in history with their corresponding status. |
| D19 | Security | **New.** Requests for access to a blocked document are always routed to the document's or owning area's responsible party — never to a fixed administrative area. |
| D20 | Taxonomy | **New.** Nine accepted document types: Standards/Regulations, Internal Procedures, Manuals, Instructions, Circulars, Bulletins, Reports, Manufacturer Documents, Complementary/Reference Documents. No closed taxonomy exists at the client; the team proposes the structure and validates it in writing before loading it into the system. |

<details>
<summary>Click to expand — Project Rules and Commit Standard</summary>

## 👥 Team Participation Rules

> _To confirm with the team — carried over from the previous semester's template as a starting point._

- A maximum of **1 absence per month** is allowed for weekly meetings
- All members must respect deadlines and adhere to the **commit standard**
- Difficulties must be communicated proactively to avoid last-minute issues before final presentations
- Every team member is expected to **present at least one sprint**

---

## 📌 Commit Standard

All commits must follow the **"Commit Pattern – by Renato Adorno"** to ensure consistency and clarity across the repository.

### Commit Format

    <type>: <description in English>

The description must:
- Be written in **English**
- Use a **direct, imperative tone**
- Be **clear and concise**

---

### 🧩 Commit Types

- **fix** – Fixes a bug
- **feat** – Introduces a new feature
- **docs** – Documentation-only changes
- **style** – Code formatting changes with no logic impact
- **refactor** – Code improvements that do not alter behavior
- **build** – Changes to the build system or dependencies
- **test** – Adding or updating tests
- **chore** – Routine maintenance tasks

---

### ✅ Examples

    feat: add document upload endpoint
    docs: update backend README
    fix: correct classification level validation
    refactor: improve OCR pipeline performance
    test: add unit tests for permission filter

---

### ⚠️ Rules

- Always write commits in **English**
- Strictly follow the defined **commit types**
- Avoid vague or uninformative messages such as:
  - `update`
  - `fix stuff`

Always prefer descriptive, actionable messages such as:

    fix: correct null pointer exception in service layer
