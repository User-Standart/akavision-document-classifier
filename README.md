# 🏅 Challenge

**AKAER** deals with the management of technical documents, an activity that demands significant time due to the volume and complexity of the concepts involved.

Today, a professional needs to read each document, manually associate it with technical standards and other related documents already stored in the company's databases, and assign labels to make future searches easier. Being a manual process, it takes hours of work and is prone to errors.

The core challenge of this initiative is to build a **technical document classifier** capable of ingesting, classifying, and indexing documents — supporting natural language search grounded in the actual archive, while enforcing access control by confidentiality level and compliance with LGPD.

---

<span id="solution"></span>

# 🏅 Solution

The proposed solution is a **document classification and retrieval platform** running entirely on **local infrastructure**, with no dependency on external APIs for document processing or answer generation.

The system will enable:

- Upload and classification of technical documents by confidentiality level (Public, Internal, Restricted, Confidential, Sensitive)
- Text extraction and OCR for scanned documents, preserving structure for citation by excerpt
- Semantic search over the archive using locally hosted embeddings
- Natural language question answering, with every claim traceable back to a document, revision, page and section
- Access control combining document classification and user profile, enforced at retrieval time
- Compliance with LGPD through data anonymization, access logging and de-characterization records

The goal is to reduce the manual effort of reading, classifying and cross-referencing technical documents, while keeping every answer auditable and grounded in the company's own archive.

|----|------------------------------|-------------|
| RNF01 | API Documentation | The system must provide clear, comprehensive documentation for all API endpoints. |
| RNF02 | Data / Database Modeling | The system must implement a well-structured data model supporting the document taxonomy and classification rules. |
| RNF03 | LGPD Anonymization | The system must implement data anonymization mechanisms in compliance with the LGPD. |
| RNF04 | Access & Manipulation Logs | The system must record logs of data access and manipulation. |
| RNF05 | De-characterization Records | The system must keep records of database de-characterization procedures. |

<span id="product-decisions"></span>

## 📐 Product Decisions

Closed decisions made by the Product Owner that orient every User Story. Changing one of these requires reviewing the affected stories.

| ID | Topic | Decision |
|----|-------|----------|
| D1 | Architecture | Document processing and answer generation run on a local model. No external API calls in the document pipeline. |
| D2 | AI | Every AI answer cites the source document, revision and excerpt. |
| D3 | AI | The answer is split into "Extracted from document" and "AI interpretation" blocks, with a notice that the interpretation is not an official company determination. |
| D4 | Taxonomy | The taxonomy has three levels: Area, Category and Subcategory, plus free tags. |
| D5 | Data Model | A document can belong to multiple areas (N:N relationship). |
| D6 | Metadata | Reference standard is an optional field. A document without an associated standard enters the archive normally. |
| D7 | Metadata | Required upload fields: title, revision, issue date, area, category, language, owner and initial classification. |
| D8 | Security | Five classification levels exist: Public, Internal, Restricted, Confidential and Sensitive. |
| D9 | Security | Permission is the intersection between document classification and user profile. Belonging to an area does not automatically grant access to all its documents. |
| D10 | Security | Documents up to Confidential are processed by the AI automatically. Sensitive documents require individual release by the owner. |
| D11 | Security | Without permission, the user sees title, classification and owner only — never the excerpt or content. |
| D12 | Process | Publishing flow: Upload, Initial classification, Validation, Available. Whoever uploads a document cannot approve its own classification. |
| D13 | Process | Requests for a missing document are routed to the owner of the selected area. |
| D14 | AI | The archive may contain English documents; questions may be asked in Portuguese or English. The answer is given in the language of the question, while the cited excerpt stays in its original language. |
| D15 | Performance | Term search under 2 seconds; AI query under 10 seconds. |
| D16 | Validation | Product validation scenario: material compatibility, in Engineering. |

<span id="getting-started"></span>

# 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### 1. Clone the repository with submodules

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/User-Standart/API-6SEM.git
cd API-6SEM
```

> **Already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`?** Run the command below to initialize the submodules:
>
> ```bash
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> ```

### 2. Configure the submodules to track their remote branches

By default, submodules are checked out in a detached HEAD state. To work on them as actual repositories (create branches, commit, push, etc.), run the following inside each submodule:

```bash
cd API-6SEM-BACKEND
git checkout develop
cd ..

cd API-6SEM-FRONTEND
git checkout develop
cd ..
```

### 3. Set up each service

Each submodule has its own setup instructions (dependencies, environment variables, run commands):

- [Backend setup](https://github.com/User-Standart/API-6SEM-BACKEND#getting-started)
- [Frontend setup](https://github.com/User-Standart/API-6SEM-FRONTEND#getting-started)

### Pulling submodule updates

To pull the latest changes from all submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

- A maximum of **1 absence per month** is allowed for weekly meetings
- All members must respect deadlines and adhere to the **commit standard**
- Difficulties must be communicated proactively to avoid last-minute issues before final presentations
- Every team member is expected to **present at least one sprint**

---

## 📌 Commit Standard

- Use a **direct, imperative tone**
- Be **clear and concise**

---

### 🧩 Commit Types

- **fix** – Fixes a bug
- **feat** – Introduces a new feature
- **docs** – Documentation-only changes
- **style** – Code formatting changes with no logic impact
- **refactor** – Code improvements that do not alter behavior
- **build** – Changes to the build system or dependencies
- **test** – Adding or updating tests
- **chore** – Routine maintenance tasks

---

### ✅ Examples

    feat: add document upload endpoint
    docs: update backend README
    fix: correct classification level validation
    refactor: improve OCR pipeline performance
    test: add unit tests for permission filter

---

### ⚠️ Rules

- Always write commits in **English**
- Strictly follow the defined **commit types**
- Avoid vague or uninformative messages such as:
